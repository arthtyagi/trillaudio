# TRILL AUDIO
TRILL AUDIO is an app to merge, equalize, and compress (or simply modify sample rate) audio files.

## Plans

- [ ] Merge audio files. (v1)
- [ ] Compress audio files. (v1)
- [ ] Change sample rate (step-up) of audio files. (v1) 
- [ ] Add spectrum analyzer 
- [ ] Add a functional equalizer. (v2)
- [ ] MIDI file to .wav files (v2)

----

- [ ] Record hot MIDI input for processing.
- [ ] One-click *slowed+reverb*
- [ ] In addition to one-click slowed+reverb, add - slow-down, speed-up, overlay, eq presets.
- [ ] Pseudo-spatialize (make it seem like the audio is spatial, should work for any audio file).

----

### Availability Plans

- [ ] Stand-alone native app in Python (v1).
- [ ] A separate plugin (C++) (equalizer and modulation features) [**maybe**]
- [ ] Web-based app (Django+React.js) (mp3 free version) [**maybe**]
